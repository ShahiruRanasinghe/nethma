        <h2>Habitat Loss and Fragmentation</h2>
        <!-- Image Placeholder -->
        <img src="Images/threat1.jpeg" alt="Habitat Loss and Fragmentation Image">

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Habitat loss and fragmentation pose significant threats to the leopard population in Sri Lanka. As human activities expand into the leopard's natural habitat, it leads to a reduction in their living spaces and the fragmentation of their habitats. This loss and fragmentation result in increased human-leopard conflicts, reduced prey availability, and disruption of the ecological balance. To mitigate these threats, conservation efforts focus on creating wildlife corridors, implementing strict land-use regulations, and promoting community-based conservation initiatives to safeguard the remaining habitats and ensure the long-term survival of leopards in Sri Lanka..</p>

        <h2>Human-Leopard Conflicts</h2>
        <!-- Image Placeholder -->
        <img src="Images/threat2.jpeg" alt="Human-Leopard Conflicts Image">

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Human-leopard conflicts arise when leopards venture into human settlements in search of food, leading to attacks on livestock or, in rare instances, humans. These encounters escalate tensions and pose risks to both humans and leopards. To mitigate this threat, various measures such as community awareness programs, the installation of deterrents, and compensation schemes for livestock losses are implemented to foster coexistence and reduce retaliatory killings of leopards..</p>

        <h2>Illegal Wildlife Trade</h2>
        <!-- Image Placeholder -->
        <img src="Images/threat3].jpeg" alt="Illegal Wildlife Trade Image">

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Illegal wildlife trade of leopards poses a severe threat to their survival, leading to a decline in their population and genetic diversity. This illegal activity drives poaching and smuggling of leopards for their valuable parts, fueled by demand in certain markets. The consequences are devastating, resulting in a direct impact on the leopard population and contributing to the broader illegal wildlife trade ecosystem. To combat this threat, enhanced law enforcement, strict penalties for poaching, and international collaborations are being implemented to curb the demand for illegal wildlife products and protect these majestic animals..</p>
